# 🚨 Deepfake Detection Project - Level 1 🚨

Welcome to my **Deepfake Detection** project! This is the **base-level model (Level 1)** designed to identify deepfake images with promising accuracy. I'm actively working on an improved version, which will be uploaded here soon! Stay tuned. 🚀

## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project leverages **Deep Learning** techniques using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build a deepfake detection model. The dataset used contains:

✅ **1000 Real Images**  
✅ **1000 Fake Images**  

For each of the following datasets:  
🔹 **Training Set**  
🔹 **Testing Set**  
🔹 **Validation Set**

## 📂 Files Included
- **`deepfake_detector.h5`** - Trained model file for prediction.  
- **`app.py`** - A simple frontend interface for users to test the model.  
- **`DeepFakeProject1.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook file with the entire model creation process.
