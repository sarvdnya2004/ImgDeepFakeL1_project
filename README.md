## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project leverages **Deep Learning** techniques using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build a deepfake detection model. The dataset used contains:

✅ **1000 Real Images**  
✅ **1000 Fake Images**  

For each of the following datasets:  
🔹 **Training Set**  
🔹 **Testing Set**  
🔹 **Validation Set**

## 📂 Files Included
- **`deepfake_detector.h5`** - Trained model file for prediction.  
- **`app.py`** - A simple frontend interface for users to test the model.  
- **`DeepFakeProject1.ipynb`** - Jupyter Notebook file with the entire model creation process.
