<hr>

Welcome to my **Deepfake Detection** project! This is the **base-level model (Level 1)** designed to identify deepfake images with promising accuracy. I'm actively working on an improved version, which will be uploaded here soon! Stay tuned. 🚀

## 🗂️ Project Overview
This project leverages **Deep Learning** techniques using **TensorFlow** and **Keras** to build a deepfake detection model. 

## 🌟 What's Inside?
✅ **`DeepFakeProject1.ipynb`** – Jupyter Notebook for model creation (includes code to save `deepfake_detector.h5`)  
✅ **`app.py`** – Web app for uploading images and predicting if they're fake or real

## 🔍 Dataset Used
📂 Dataset Link: [Deepfake and Real Images on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/manjilkarki/deepfake-and-real-images)  
- **1000 Real + 1000 Fake** for Training  
- **1000 Real + 1000 Fake** for Testing  
- **1000 Real + 1000 Fake** for Validation

## ⚙️ Model Saving Instructions
The `.h5` model file is **not included** in this repo to reduce size.  
✅ To generate `deepfake_detector.h5`, run the **last cell** in the `DeepFakeProject1.ipynb` file — the model will be saved automatically.

## 🚀 Next Steps
This is our **Level 1** model — a baseline DeepFake detector. Stay tuned for **Level 2** with improved accuracy and advanced features! 🔥


💻 **Created with passion and dedication!** If you find this helpful, don't forget to ⭐ the repo! 😊
